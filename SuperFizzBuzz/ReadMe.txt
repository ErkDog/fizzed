SuperFizzBuzz Coding Exercize

3rd party Nuget packages: NUnit

All unit tests are in the SuperFizzBuzz.UnitTests project.

There is only one main class called SuperFizzBuzz.cs that has all the code in it.

The two console apps are included in this solution for simplicity and to help keep everything together.
You can either set each project individually as the startup project and press F5, or go to each of their
respective bin folders and run the executables manually.


Enjoy,
